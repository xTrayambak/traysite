# Hello World
Hiya. My name is Trayambak, but my friends tend to call me Tray. \
I mostly do my work in Nim, C and C++, mostly related to interpreters, compilers and other systems work.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) as my daily driver.

This just serves as the base article for my site, with more of my ramblings set to follow suit soon. :^)
